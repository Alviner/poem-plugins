[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Alviner/poem-plugins/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/Alviner/poem-plugins?branch=main)

A set of plugins for [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/).

## How to use

Make sure you have Poetry version `1.4.0` or above. Read below for instructions to install it if you haven't.

### Install Poem Plugins

Install this plugin to your Poetry:

```(console)
poetry self add poem-plugins
```

### Version Plugin

The poetry plugin for project versioning allows users to specify
the version of their project via the provider other than the default `pyproject.toml` file.
This can be useful for users who prefer to set the project version based on a git tag, for example.

Plugin can be configured via a section in the `pyproject.toml` file.
To use the plugin, you will need to add a section to your `pyproject.toml`
file that specifies the provider.

Here's an example of how you might configure the plugin in your `pyproject.toml` file:

```(toml)
[tool.poem-plugins.version]
provider = "git"
```

Likewise, you can specify a number of optional arguments to control the plugin
behavior. Here are some of the arguments that you can use:
| Name | description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `update_pyproject` | plugin will not only use version from provider for building, but save it in `pyproject.toml` | `false` |
| `update_pyproject_place` | place to update version in `pyproject.toml`. Use `project` with [PEP 621](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#version) compatability | `tool.poetry` |
| `write_version_file` | plugin will create a file `version.py` inside a module, with version information | `false` |
| `version_file_quotes` | plugin will replace default quotes in `version.py` file with provided by: `'` or `"` | `unset` |


You can specify provider-specific settings in your configuration.
To specify provider-specific settings, you can use the `tool.poem-plugins.version.{provider}` section.
Here are some of the arguments that you can use for `git` provider:
| Name | description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `version_prefix` | filter tags only starts with this prefix | `v` |
| `format` | plugin will use commit hash (long) or not (short) to build a project version | `short` |
| `bump_segment` | plugin will bump the selected version's segment with the number of commits after the last tag (allowed `release`, `post`, `dev`) | `release` |


Example:

```(toml)
[tool.poem-plugins.version.git]
version_prefix = "v"
format = "short"
```

To build your project, run the `poetry build` command.
The plugin will build the version via provider and use it to set the version for the project.

```(console)
$ git tag -a v0.1 -m 'tag description'
$ poetry build
poem-plugins: Setting version to: 0.1.0
Building awesome_package (0.1.0)
  - Building sdist
  - Built awesome_package-0.1.0.tar.gz
  - Building wheel
  - Built awesome_package-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Logic behind `bump_segment` with 10 commits:
* `release`: bumps `patch` (as in `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`) or the lowest
  * `1 -> 1.0.10`
  * `1.0 -> 1.0.10`
  * `1.0.2 -> 1.0.12`  
  * `1.0.0.2 -> 1.0.0.12`
* `post`: bumps `post`
  * `1.0 -> 1.0.post10`
  * `1.0.post2 -> 1.0.post12`
* `dev`: bumps `dev`
  * `1.0 -> 1.0.dev10`
  * `1.0.dev2 -> 1.0.dev12`

## How to develop

Before getting started with development, you'll need to have poetry installed.

Once you have poetry installed, you can create a virtual environment for the project by running:

```(bash)
poetry install
```

This will also install all the dependencies required for the project.

### Pre-commit hooks

This project uses pre-commit to automatically run
simple formatter `gray` before committing changes.
To set up the pre-commit hooks, run the following
command in the project root:

```(bash)
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Type checking

This project uses `mypy` for type checking.
You can run the type checker
with the following command:

```(bash)
poetry run mypy poem_plugins
```

### Linting

This project uses `pylama` for linting.
You can run the linter
with the following command:

```(bash)
poetry run pylama poem_plugins
```

### Tests

We use `pytest` for running tests.
You can run the tests
with the following command:

```(bash)
poetry run pytest
```

Please make sure that all tests pass and linter and type checker does not
report any issues before submitting a pull request.
